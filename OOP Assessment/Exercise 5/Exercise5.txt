-Spread Operator (...):
The spread operator in JavaScript is denoted by three dots (...). It is used to unpack elements from arrays, objects, or strings.
The spread operator allows us to spread the elements of an iterable (e.g., an array or object) into another array, object, or function arguments.
It makes it easier to clone or merge arrays/objects and to pass multiple elements to a function as separate arguments.

-'$' Symbol:
In JavaScript, the dollar sign ($) symbol is commonly associated with libraries like jQuery. Within jQuery, the dollar sign is an alias for the
jQuery object,making it easier to select and manipulate DOM elements.' However, outside of jQuery, the dollar sign does not have any special
meaning in standard JavaScript.

Static Method:
A static method is a method that belongs to a class rather than an instance of the class. It is accessed directly from the class and not from an
instance of the class. Static methods are useful for utility functions or operations that do not require access to instance-specific properties.
They are defined using the static keyword in front of the method name.

map Method:
The map() method is an array method in JavaScript that creates a new array by applying a provided function to each element of the calling array.
It transforms each element of the array and returns a new array with the transformed values. The original array remains unchanged.

item Method:
The term "item method" is not a standard JavaScript method. It is possible that it refers to a method used in a specific library or application,
but without further context or specification, it is not possible to provide a detailed explanation.

join Method:
The join() method is an array method that concatenates all the elements of an array into a single string, separated by the specified separator.
The method does not change the original array but returns a new string representing the joined elements.
